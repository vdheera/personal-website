## Coming Soon ðŸ‘€

just a collection of random fun facts, favorite websites, and other things I can't put in a box.

Being a Cognitive Science major means, I get to take classes across a wide variety of departments (to date, I've taken classes across 13 different departments). Some of my favorite classes so far include:

1. ANTHRBIO 240
2. HISTORY 206
3. ECON 350 - Economics of Education
4. POLSCI 490
5. EECS 490 - how to build a search engine.
