## Values 

Here’s a glimpse into some of the values I try to live by. I’m constantly refining them. 

1. No one is self made. Show your appreciation often – especially to those closest to you & pass on the generosity someone showed you. 
2. Every single detail matters. The details are what makes something go from average -> exceptional. 
3. You are the average of the 5 people around you. Surround yourself with people you want to be like – but this doesn’t mean to put down others. 
4. 10x mentality – Always challenge yourself to think about how something can be even greater, even more impactful & when you have set your ambitions higher, remind yourself there is no excuse to not achieving it. 
5. Full Send Everything – Whether it’s your job, organizing your friend’s birthday, or a workout – adopt the 10x mentality & attention to detail in every part of your life. 

## Roadtripping

My family is big on roadtrips. There’s no better way to get to know someone.

My favorite has to be from my hometown of Nashua, NH to Nova Scotia, Canada. I've also roadtripped a large portion of California and Mountain West (including SF, Arizona, Nevada, Utah) & Boston to Florida!

## Personal Travel Mission

My parents, both Indian immigrants, grew up in or around rural villages & later moved to large urban cities in India. Whenever I visit, I notice a world of difference between the two. 

I realized that whenever I travel to a new country, I almost always visit the urban areas. I want to make it a point to visit both the urban and rural areas because you can learn so much about a country, its culture & its people by visiting both. 

## Favorite Classes

For most of my life, my favorite classes have always been the humanities ones and even today, I have a huge appreciation for the liberal arts. It’s why I chose to take classes across 12 departments at the University of Michigan. Here are some of my favorites: 

1. EECS 281: Algorithms & Data Structures – a classic but so important.  
2. PPE 300: Introduction to the Political Economy – putting first principles thinking into action
3. ANTHRBIO 201: How Humans Evolved – this class blew my mind more than any other.
