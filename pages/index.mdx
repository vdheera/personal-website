## Hey, I'm Dheera!

I'm currently studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science at the University of Michigan. Go Blue 〽️

Outside of school, I **play the violin** in student orchestra and help run **Michigan's premier entrepreneurship organization**, [V1](https://v1michigan.com)!

In the past, I've interned as a PM at Squarespace and a software engineer at Fidelity Investments. In my free time, I like to go on long walks, read, and scroll through Pinterest!

I love meeting new people. Reach out via Twitter DM's or @ dheera.vuppala@gmail.com if you want to chat!
