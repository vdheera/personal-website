Hi, I'm Dheera! I'm a **software engineer**. Most recently I worked at [Ascend](https://www.useascend.com/), an all-in-one payments solution purpose built for insurance. 

Previously I interned at [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) as a Product Manager, [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/) as a Software Engineer & even did a short stint in VC. 

I studied **Computer Science & Cognitive Science at the University of Michigan 〽️.** On campus, I helped build **[V1 Michigan](https://v1michigan.com/) – the premier community for ambitious student builders**, where I wrote our [newsletter](https://v1network.substack.com/) & launched a [product studio](https://studio.v1michigan.com/), in addition to other roles I played. 

I also write about tech, startups, life lessons, & whatever else is on my mind. You can check out past posts [here](/writing). You can also follow me on [Curius](https://curius.app/dheera-vuppala), a collaborative bookmarking & highlighting tool for the internet, to see what I’ve been reading. For a list of books, check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92278496-dheera-vuppala). 

I love meeting new people and jamming on new ideas, talking about the switch from PM -> SWE, or anything else. Reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dheera_vuppala) DM's or shoot me a note at [dheera.vuppala@gmail.com](mailto:dheera.vuppala@gmail.com).
